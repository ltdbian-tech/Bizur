Bizur v1.4 - What's New
=======================

Contact Delivery Fixes
----------------------
• Peercode registration on connect so contact requests route reliably
• Server maps BZ codes to device identities; requests now reach online/offline peers

Delete & Manage
---------------
• Delete contacts (with confirmation) also clears chat history
• Long-press chats to delete conversations and messages; contacts remain
• Cancel pending outgoing requests directly from the contacts list

Stability & UX
--------------
• Improved queue handling when peers are offline
• Minor UI polish and dependency updates
